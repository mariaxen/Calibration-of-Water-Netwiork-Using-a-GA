This is an EPANET wrapper developed in R used to skeletonize a water network and calibrate the pipe roughness of the skeletonized network based on node pressures from the original network. For the calibration module you need to have EPANET and R installed and for the skeletonisation you also need to have an executable developed by EPA called spotSkeleton.exe (see https://prod-ng.sandia.gov/techlib-noauth/access-control.cgi/2014/1416973.pdf), saved in the same folder as the R script.
